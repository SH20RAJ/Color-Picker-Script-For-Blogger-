# Material Color Picker

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/SH20RAJ/pen/JjKLQqM](https://codepen.io/SH20RAJ/pen/JjKLQqM).

I  came across this [Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/2594885-Material-Colors-for-Mac) a little while back and thought it'd be fun to build out for myself. Yes, I am aware there's already a Mac app for it.

I used [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) to let the data control the markup, and used `currentColor` to make the styles a little more elegant. I also added in [clipboard.js](https://clipboardjs.com/) to make it nice and easy to grab colors.

_Suggestions welcome! Especially for how to make the "copy to clipboard" part a little more interesting, as well as any ways to improve/automate text contrast on some of the darker colors._
